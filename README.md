## Investigate-baseball-dataset

In this project, I will be performing Data Analysis on the Baseball Dataset. Following are the steps followed alongwith the questions, answers, detailed description and summary of the data analysis performed.

Step One - Choosing the Data Set : Baseball Data
The files chosen for Data Analysis in this project:
The dataset comprises of many different files, but since detailed analysis of every file can lead to infinite data wrangling possibilities, I am going to choose a few files and perform my analysis on them. Following are the tables I am most interested in:
 
### Main tables: 
Batting - batting statistics 

Pitching - Pitching statistics 

Fielding - Fielding statistics 

### Supporting Tables:
 Salaries - player salary data
 
 Teams - yearly stats and standings
 
 Appearances - details on the positions a player appeared at
 
 AwardsPlayers - awards won by players
